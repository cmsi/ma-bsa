Description: Kernel Method for Finite-Size Scaling Analysis of Critical Phenomena
 The new method is based on the Gaussian process regression, which is
 called kernel method. After the advent of kernel methods in the machine
 learning community, the method of data analysis was drastically changed.
 Because the kernel method is very flexible for complex real data, the
 power of the kernel method can also help our scaling analysis.
